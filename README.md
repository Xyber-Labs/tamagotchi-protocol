# Protocol for Collective Agent Creation

A new **open protocol** for collective creation and evolution of digital agents.  
From the start, it’s designed to be **DAO-native** — managed and developed openly,  
with governance and selection happening through on-chain voting.  
**Anyone in the world can participate.**

## Purpose
- Define a shared standard for agent evolution (levels, trait scoring, milestones).  
- Enable transparent, decentralized governance through DAO mechanisms.  
- Reward contributors (art, code, lore, animation, etc.) with on-chain recognition and tokenized incentives.

## Core Principles
- **Openness:** Code, standards, and processes are fully public.  
- **Decentralization:** All key decisions and merges happen through on-chain voting.  
- **Collaboration:** Collective development, with proposals merged via community selection.  
- **Fair Incentives:** Verifiable, tokenized rewards for meaningful contributions.

## How to Participate
1. Open a discussion or issue proposing your idea (art, code, specification, etc.).  
2. Submit your contribution via PR; go through open review and DAO voting.  
3. Approved contributions are merged, and on-chain metadata is updated accordingly.
